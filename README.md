# Queasy - Queueing Made Easy

Queasy is an online queueing system specifically designed to ease the process of waiting for SNMPTN re-registration process. It is designed with seamlessness in mind. The ultimate goal of this project is to reduce the total time required to finish the queue and ease the physical strain of the queue participants.

## Modules

Queasy consists of four primary modules:

 1. Backend -- receives and manages queues.
 2. Reception Kiosk -- scans preliminary document barcode and issues queue number.
 3. Display Board -- Displays currently-processed queue numbers and estimates of a specific queue number.
 4. Service Desk -- Allows operators to proceed to the next queue.
